# V4_12_MyProject_1

This project is an Unreal Engine 4.12.5 basic C++ project with a Blueprint C++ Plugin which
provides about several Linear Congruential Random Number Generators blueprint nodes.

All Plugin files are provided. Nothing has been removed from the Unreal Project. Open the Blueprint level to find an example and the nodes.

Do anything you want with it and, if you have time, keep me posted.

If you can read french, steps by steps description of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/PCfVW/V4_12_MyProject_1/blob/master/%C3%89tapes%20du%20Projet%20Cr%C3%A9ation%20d'un%20Plugin%20pour%20l'Unreal%20Engine%204.12.5%20(4).pdf).

If not, sorry then, as I might not go into translating this one;
but you can still use the Plugin in a specific project or as an UE4 Plugin for any of your porjects.
